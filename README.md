# This Is Happening

Locate, summarize, and visualize pockets of social activity in meatspace.

This app detects geotagged Twitter activity that stands out above typical background levels and tweets about it.

## TODO

### Data

- Tweets
  - [x] Use a density-based metric for event detection, rather than aggregating within pre-defined boundaries (map tiles) and tracking statistics for each tile
    - [ ] Define activity thresholds using intuitive, human readable values
  - [x] Prevent a single prolific user from easily triggering an event by decreasing the weight of their tweets
  - [x] Deduplicate tokens within each tweet
  - [ ] Separate "canonical city location" tweets from other geotagged activity. Could identify these tweets by selecting the ones with a specific longitude and latitude.
  - [ ] Detect and ignore spam tweets, e.g., job postings, apartment listings
- Queries
  - [x] Provide access to the tweets associated with each event
  - [x] Write query to keep most recent N days of data and run in main loop
  - [x] Maintain maximum recent_tweets table row count and run in main loop

### ML for event finding

- [x] Clustering
  - [x] When an event is found, run a clustering algorithm (DBSCAN) on all recent tweets to determine the full set of event tweets
  - [x] Define cluster neighborhood limits using intuitive, human readable values (e.g., kilometers)

### Publishing / Analytics

- [x] When an event is found, tweet an image of a map with the location/heat map
- [x] Set my tweet's location to the event latitude and longitude
- [ ] Exclude my own tweets from the search
- [ ] Plot the pulse of a neighborhood over time: count of tweets by hour

## Realizations

- Many tweets show up at the canonical city location, especially due to Swarm's "posted a photo" feature
- Using tiles / artificial region boundaries required more workarounds and convoluted solutions than originally expected. Some downsides:
  - Potentially splits events across regions
  - Keeping the running statistics requires storing many rows in database table; wouldn't be an issue if I wasn't trying to operate on a shoestring budget because I could run my own database
- It's not uncommon to get a false alarm due to one user posting many tweets in a short time period
- To add a location to the bot tweets, need to enable in: Settings and privacy -> Privacy and safety -> Location information -> Add location information to your Tweets
